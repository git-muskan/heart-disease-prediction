# heart-disease-prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease within the next 10 years. Using a range of parameters including demographic data, lifestyle factors, and medical history, the goal is to build a predictive model.

The Heart Disease Prediction Model project was a comprehensive exercise in predictive analytics, with the intent of diagnosing heart disease using various clinical parameters. The project utilized machine learning techniques to anticipate heart disease occurrence based on individual health metrics.

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, encompassing demographic information (age and sex), and clinical parameters, such as history of stroke, hypertension status, cholesterol (chol), blood pressure (bp), presence of diabetes etc.

After data retrieval, an intensive data cleaning process ensued, with procedures like the removal of duplicates and null values, and data mapping. This essential phase ensured that the data quality was optimal for the subsequent analysis.

The project then progressed to the data preprocessing phase, which involved a robust exploratory data analysis. 

Once the data was adequately prepared, predictive analysis was performed using Logistic Regression. The performance of model was evaluated using confusion matrices, providing detailed insight into the accuracy, precision, and recall of each model.

Finally, the performance of the models was compared with respect to accuracy and visually represented through plots. This allowed for a clear and understandable depiction of the best performing model for heart disease prediction.

The Heart Disease Prediction Model project successfully employed various data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning methods to predict heart disease occurrences, demonstrating the value of these tools in health-related predictive analytics.
